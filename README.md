## About the Project

The concept for this project was to develop an app on which me we can match users with the same intolerances and in that way they can cook together via online by scheduling a cooking session based on the recipes that they have saved and intolerances.

## Plans for Improvement

As a future plan we have decided to develop a Live Chat Box with emojis in order for the vegan pals to have a more easy way to communicate with each other. And also a save recipe button so that when you click on it will render users who also liked this recipe.
